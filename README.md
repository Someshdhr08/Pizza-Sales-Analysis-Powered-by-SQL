# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Powered-by-SQL
Recently, I dove into a pizza sales dataset to uncover some tasty insights using SQL. From identifying the best-selling pizza types to analyzing peak order hours and tracking monthly revenue trends — it was fascinating to see how structured queries can turn raw numbers into valuable business decisions.
Key highlights:
📈 Top 5 most popular pizza flavors
⏰ Busiest order times across the week
💰 Highest revenue-generating pizza sizes
📊 Hour-on-hour sales performance trends
SQL’s ability to slice through large datasets and deliver clear, actionable insights makes it an essential tool for any data-driven business decision — and what better dataset to work with than pizza? 😄🍕
